if you submit a form with action, (method is GET in this case)
you need to give the method name in the action

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>GET Form</title></head>
<body>

GET: <form action="{{ url_for('process_with_get') }}">

POST: <form method="post"> --> it will go to the method where this html was rendered from 

 <p>Input s: <input name="s"></p>
 <p><input type="submit"></p>
</form>
</body>
</html>
